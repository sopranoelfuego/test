First, run the development server for the development mode the server will run on port 3001:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the result.

yarn build
# then run
yarn start

npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
